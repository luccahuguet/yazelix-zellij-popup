# Yazelix Zellij Popup

Yazelix Zellij Popup is a small Zellij plugin for toggling configured floating TUI popups. The Zellij plugin alias and wasm artifact are `yzpp`.

It gives plain Zellij users the popup behavior that Yazelix uses for tools like git UIs: press one key to open the floating pane, press it again from another pane to focus it, press it while the popup is focused to close it.

## Install

Build the plugin:

```bash
nix build .#yazelix-zellij-popup
```

`.#yzpp` is also provided as a short package alias for the plugin artifact.

The package installs:

- `share/yazelix_zellij_popup/yzpp.wasm`
- `share/yazelix_zellij_popup/examples/gitui.kdl`
- `share/yazelix_zellij_popup/examples/gitui.template.kdl`

## Configure

Add the plugin and a popup spec to your Zellij config:

```kdl
plugins {
    yzpp location="file:/path/to/yzpp.wasm" {
        popup_defaults {
            side_margin 1
            vertical_margin 0
        }

        popup {
            command "gitui"
            pane_title "gitui_popup"
            command_marker "gitui"
            cwd "."
            width_percent 90
            height_percent 85
        }
    }
}

load_plugins {
    yzpp
}

keybinds {
    normal {
        bind "Alt g" {
            MessagePlugin "yzpp" {
                name "toggle"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The message `name` is the action. Supported actions are `toggle`, `open`,
`focus`, `replace`, and `close`. When there is only one configured popup or a
`default` popup, no payload is needed. A caller that owns cwd policy can send
`{"id":"agent","cwd":"/repo"}` instead of a plain popup id; the configured
spec remains the command and layout owner. `focus` never hides a live popup and
replaces it when its remembered launch cwd differs from an explicit request cwd.
`replace` closes any matching live pane and opens a fresh one atomically, running
its configured `on_close` hook before relaunch.

## Popup Specs

The default popup uses a nested `popup` block:

```kdl
popup {
    command "gitui"
    arg_1 "--watch"
    pane_title "gitui_popup"
    command_marker "gitui"
    cwd "."
    width_percent 90
    height_percent 85
}
```

Required:

- `command`

Optional:

- `arg_1`, `arg_2`, and so on for argv arguments
- `pane_title`, defaulting to `default_popup`
- `preserve_terminal_title`, defaulting to `false`; when `true`, the launch title is cleared, pane identity uses the command marker, and the application may publish its terminal title
- `command_marker`, defaulting to the command path
- `cwd`, defaulting to the focused terminal pane cwd; relative values resolve against that focused cwd
- `on_close`, an optional command hook run when `yzpp` closes the popup through `toggle` or `close`
- `on_hide`, an optional command hook run when `yzpp` hides the popup through focused `toggle` or popup displacement
- `toggle_close_behavior`, either `close` or `hide`, defaulting to `close`
- `width_percent`, defaulting to `90`
- `height_percent`, defaulting to `85`
- `side_margin`, defaulting to `popup_defaults.side_margin` or `0`
- `vertical_margin`, defaulting to `popup_defaults.vertical_margin` or `0`

Width and height must be integers from `1` through `100`. Commands are argv, not shell strings.

Use `popup_defaults` to share margins and lifecycle hooks across configured popups:

```kdl
popup_defaults {
    side_margin 1
    vertical_margin 0

    on_close {
        command "hook"
        arg_1 "close"
    }

    on_hide {
        command "hook"
        arg_1 "hide"
    }
}

popups {
    gitui {
        command "gitui"
    }

    lazygit {
        command "lazygit"
        side_margin 3
        vertical_margin 2
    }
}
```

Per-popup `side_margin`, `vertical_margin`, `on_close`, and `on_hide` override the shared defaults

Hooks are also argv, not shell strings:

```kdl
popup {
    command "lazygit"
    pane_title "lazygit_popup"
    on_close {
        command "hook"
        arg_1 "close"
    }
    on_hide {
        command "hook"
        arg_1 "hide"
    }
}
```

`on_close` runs only when `yzpp` closes the pane in response to `toggle` or `close`. It does not run when the child process exits on its own.

`on_hide` runs only when `yzpp` hides the pane because a focused hide-mode popup was toggled or another configured popup displaced it. It does not run when the pane is opened, shown, focused, explicitly closed, or when the child process exits on its own.

Use `toggle_close_behavior "hide"` for monitor TUIs that should keep process state between toggles:

```kdl
popup {
    command "btm"
    pane_title "btm_popup"
    toggle_close_behavior "hide"
}
```

With `hide`, pressing the toggle key while the popup is focused and the floating layer is visible, or replacing it with another configured popup, hides that pane without killing the popup process and runs `on_hide`. Pressing the toggle key again shows and focuses the existing pane, including when Zellij hid the floating layer while moving focus to a tiled pane, provided its remembered launch cwd still matches the effective request cwd. Applications may change their own process cwd while running without becoming stale. If the requested launch cwd changes, toggle closes the stale pane (and runs `on_close` if set) and opens a fresh popup there. The explicit `close` action still closes the pane and runs `on_close`.

For multiple popups in the same plugin config, use a nested `popups` block and send the popup id as the payload:

```kdl
popups {
    gitui {
        command "gitui"
        pane_title "gitui_popup"
        width_percent 90
        height_percent 85
    }

    lazygit {
        command "lazygit"
        pane_title "lazygit_popup"
        width_percent 92
        height_percent 88
    }
}
```

```kdl
MessagePlugin "yzpp" {
    name "toggle"
    payload "lazygit"
}
```

## Raw Pipe API

Generated integrations may still send the raw JSON request shape through `name "transient_popup"`:

```kdl
MessagePlugin "yzpp" {
    name "transient_popup"
    payload "{\"action\":\"toggle\",\"spec\":{\"id\":\"gitui\",\"pane_title\":\"gitui_popup\",\"command_marker\":\"gitui\",\"command\":[\"gitui\"],\"cwd\":\".\",\"width_percent\":90,\"height_percent\":85},\"args\":[]}"
}
```

That raw path exists for generated callers. Human-authored Zellij config should prefer configured popup specs plus `name "toggle"`.

Raw JSON specs support the same optional `on_close` and `on_hide` hook objects as configured popup specs.

## Permissions

Zellij prompts for plugin permissions when the plugin first loads. `yzpp` requests:

- `ReadApplicationState`
- `ChangeApplicationState`
- `OpenTerminalsOrPlugins`
- `RunCommands`
- `ReadCliPipes`

These permissions cover pane discovery, opening command panes, focusing and closing the managed pane, and receiving `MessagePlugin` pipe requests.

## Verify

```bash
cargo test
nix build
